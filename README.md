## Calculator App

Simple calculator utilising React + TypeScript.

## Features
* Four operations: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication.
* Supports Key input and mouse clicks/finger taps.
* Layout of the Calculator inspired by Windows 10 calculator
* Has a visible operation memory display, and a current number display
* Three clear buttons: backspace which deletes last character, C wwhich clears current selection, and CA which clears memory of operations as well.
* Knows about the order of operations, so 2+2\*2 equals 6, not 8 ;)
